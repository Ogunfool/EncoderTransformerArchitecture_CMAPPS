# EncoderTransformerArchitecture_CMAPPS
An encoder-transformer architecture-based framework for multi-variate time series prediction with a prognostics use case. 
We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on all four sets of the C-MAPPS benchmark dataset for the remaining useful life prediction task.
